## Data Engineering Portfolio

Greetings! Welcome to my GitHub data engineering portfolio. I'm Emmanuel, a data engineer passionate about building robust data pipelines and infrastructure.

I'm excited to present my evolving data engineering portfolio. This repository showcases a catalog of projects completed during my journey through AltSchool's data engineering courses and various self-development exercises. Each project demonstrates essential skills and techniques in the field of data engineering.

### [Postgres infrastructure with Docker](https://github.com/emmlard/data-engineering-portfolio-projects/tree/main/postgres_docker_init)

- Overview: This project sets up a basic PostgreSQL infrastructure using Docker and Docker Compose. It includes loading data from a CSV file and interacting with the database using Python. The primary goal is to demonstrate a straightforward method for setting up and managing a PostgreSQL database in a containerized environment.

### [Real-Time IoT Data Pipeline](https://github.com/emmlard/data-engineering-portfolio-projects/tree/main/streaming-iot-pipeline)

- Overview: This project demonstrates the creation of a real-time data pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to process and analyze IoT device data. The pipeline ingests data from simulated IoT devices, processes it using Dataflow, and stores it in BigQuery and Cloud Storage for further analysis and visualization.
