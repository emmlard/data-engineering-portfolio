## Data Engineering Portfolio

Greetings! Welcome to my GitHub data engineering portfolio. I'm Emmanuel, a data engineer passionate about building robust data pipelines and infrastructure.

I'm excited to present my evolving data engineering portfolio. This repository showcases a catalog of projects completed during my journey through AltSchool's data engineering courses and various self-development exercises. Each project demonstrates essential skills and techniques in the field of data engineering.
